# Bank-Customer-Churn-Analysis

## Our Project Description
As commonly understood, acquiring a new customer incurs higher costs compared to retaining an existing one.
Hence, it is beneficial for banks to understand the reasons that prompt a customer to terminate their association with the institution.
By preventing customer churn, companies can design loyalty programs and retention initiatives aimed at retaining a maximum number of customers.
